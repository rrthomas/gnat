Object-oriented Forth syntax

CREATE[ ... ] for per instance declarations. Compile immediate words and save
others as literal strings. At run-time, run the NEW" method of each class
compiled, supplying the literal string on the stack.

DOES[ ... ] for methods. Go into interpretation mode after DOES[ and compile
into a private dictionary.

DOES> and CREATE work as normal: CREATE is effectively CREATE[ ] and DOES> is
DOES[ :NONAME ... ].

DEFAULT after a declaration in CREATE[ ... ] or DOES[ ... ] makes that method
the default.

Modify the parser to allow the following syntax:

object		executes default method of object
object.method	executes method of object
class_method	executes method of class on the object on the stack
O' object	returns the object pointer of object.

Can parse the top three after attempting to parse a token as a number (should
be before for efficiency, but after for ANS compatibility; and yet not, as if
no non-ANSI object words are created, this effect will not occur).
